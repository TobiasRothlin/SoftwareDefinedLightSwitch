## Introduction
The Software Defined Light Switch is a smart light switch that can be controlled via software. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller to manage the switching mechanism and can be integrated with various home automation systems.

## Features
- Remote control via Wi-Fi
- Integration with home automation systems
- Customizable firmware
- 3D printable case
- PCB design for easy assembly

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Custom PCB (design files included)
- 3D printed case (CAD files included)
- Standard electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc.)

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- ESP32 board support package
- Required libraries (listed in the firmware documentation)

## Installation
1. **3D Printing**: Print the case using the provided CAD files.
2. **PCB Assembly**: Manufacture the PCB using the provided design files and assemble the components.
3. **Firmware Upload**: Upload the firmware to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

## Usage
1. Install the hardware in place of your existing light switch.
2. Connect the ESP32 to your Wi-Fi network.
3. Use the provided software or integrate with your home automation system to control the light switch.
